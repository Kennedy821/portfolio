Polls aren‚Äôt inherently bad but relying solely on them feels a bit dated, especially when we have powerful language models and abundant data at our fingertips. So, could we predict election results without polling at all?

                Turns out that you can (in the most part). Using past voting patterns and some quick-and-dirty ML models, Election Slugbot generated impressive  headline seat predictions, even matching the official exit poll pretty closely in one case. It wasn‚Äôt perfect, particularly when drilling down to seat-level details, nonetheless, it demonstrates that even a straightforward ML approach can rival traditional polling.
